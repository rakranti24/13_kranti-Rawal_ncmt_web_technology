         Scenario-Based Questions
 A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. However, they are being advised to use
a dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.
= No, I would not agree with using a dynamic website.
The company wants to show the same information to all users and wants low maintenance cost. A static website is better because it is simple, cheaper, faster, and does not need a database or frequent updates. A dynamic website is more complex and costs more, so it is not suitable in this case.

9. A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a ”Server Not
Found” error, even though the internet connection is active. However, accessing the sitevia 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology
that failed
= The problem is with the DNS (Domain Name System).
When a user types www.google.com, the browser uses DNS to convert the website name into an IP address. In this case, the DNS is not working properly, so the browser cannot find the server.
However, when the IP address 142.250.190.46 is typed directly, the website opens because DNS is not needed. So, the DNS system failed.

10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers
but does not want this information available to the general public. Explain which network
type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why.
= The company should use an Extranet.
An Extranet allows a company to share information with specific external users, such as suppliers or partners, while keeping the data private and secure.
The Internet is public and not safe for sensitive data, and an Intranet is only for internal employees.
